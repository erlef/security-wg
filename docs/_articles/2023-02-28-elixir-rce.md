This post shows how unsafe use of `:erlang.binary_to_term/2` (even with `:safe`)
can enable remote code execution in Elixir/Phoenix apps, demonstrates a real
Paginator exploit that deserializes attacker-supplied functions, and gives
practical fixes â€” use `non_executable_binary_to_term/2`, run Sobelow scans, and
follow secure serialization guidance to prevent RCE.
