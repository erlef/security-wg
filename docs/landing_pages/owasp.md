The EEF Security Working Group and [OWASP][owasp_website] share a mission to
encourage secure software development practices and to share practical,
actionable knowledge with developers worldwide. While OWASP resources tend to
be platform agnostic, the EEF Security WG focusses on the Erlang ecosystem,
making the provided resources very much complementary.

Our [Secure Coding and Deployment Hardening Guidelines](/secure_coding_and_deployment_hardening)
and [Web Application Security Best Practices for BEAM languages](/web_app_security_best_practices_beam)
documents aim to highlight platform-specific issues that BEAM developers should
be aware of, where possible referencing OWASP resources that cover the
underlying issue. But these documents are by no means intended to cover all
aspects of secure coding and web development: many potential security issues
are mostly or entirely platform agnostic, and those are very well documented by
OWASP resources, including:

* [OWASP Top Ten][owasp_top10]
* [OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][owasp_cheatsheets]
* [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)][owasp_asvs]

We strongly encourage BEAM users interested in cybersecurity, whether for web
applications or other types of projects, to get familiar with the available
[OWASP projects][owasp_projects], and to consider joining OWASP, as a member or
at one of the many events they host worldwide.
