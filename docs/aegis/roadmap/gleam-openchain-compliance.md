## Goal

Certify OpenChain (ISO/IEC 5230) compliance for the gleam-lang/gleam GitHub
project.

## Impact

Obtaining an OpenChain Certification (ISO/IEC 5230) for the Gleam language would
demonstrate that its open source compliance processes meet a globally recognized
standard, thereby instilling confidence among current and potential adopters
that Gleam maintains robust and consistent license and governance practices.
This heightened trust can lower perceived risk for commercial organizations
considering Gleam, accelerating corporate adoption and collaboration. In turn,
the certification signals to contributors and the wider community that Gleam is
a well-managed and future-proof platform, aligning with best practices in open
source compliance and providing a solid foundation for long-term project
sustainability.

## Deliverables

* Self-Certification of the Gleam project.

## Relevant Standards

* [ISO/IEC 5230](https://www.iso.org/standard/81039.html)
