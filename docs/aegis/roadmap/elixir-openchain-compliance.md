## Goal

Certify OpenChain (ISO/IEC 5230) compliance for the elixir-lang/elixir GitHub
project.

## Impact

Obtaining an OpenChain Certification (ISO/IEC 5230) for the Elixir project would
demonstrate that its open source compliance processes meet a globally recognized
standard, thereby instilling confidence among current and potential adopters
that the project maintains robust and consistent license and governance
practices. This heightened trust can lower perceived risk for commercial
organizations considering Elixir, accelerating corporate adoption and
collaboration. In turn, the certification signals to contributors and the wider
community that Elixir is a well-managed and future-proof language, aligning with
best practices in open source compliance and providing a solid foundation for
long-term project sustainability.
