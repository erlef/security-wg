## Goal

Certify OpenChain (ISO/IEC 5230) compliance for the erlang/otp GitHub project.

## Impact

Obtaining an OpenChain Certification (ISO/IEC 5230) for the Erlang project would
demonstrate that its open source compliance processes meet a globally recognized
standard, thereby instilling confidence among current and potential adopters
that the project maintains robust and consistent license and governance
practices. This heightened trust can lower perceived risk for commercial
organizations considering Erlang, accelerating corporate adoption and
collaboration. In turn, the certification signals to contributors and the wider
community that Erlang is a well-managed and future-proof platform, aligning with
best practices in open source compliance and providing a solid foundation for
long-term project sustainability.
