## Goal

Define Governance structure for core projects

## Impact

By conducting a thorough governance audit and establishing a clear governance
structure for pivotal open source projects (Erlang, Elixir, Gleam, and Hex),
this milestone ensures transparency, continuity, and trust across the ecosystem.
Deliverables include a detailed checklist to guide governance best practices,
the formal documentation of existing structures, and explicit contingency plans
to address maintainer incapacitation. Additionally, efforts to encourage
Ericssonâ€™s formal governance process for Erlang, along with guidance for other
projects to publish their governance documentation, underscore the commitment to
robust oversight. Finally, by codifying rules around Licensing, IP, copyright,
patents, and the stewardship of trademarks and domains, the audit paves the way
for stable long-term project leadership and fosters broader community confidence
in the core tooling stack.
