## Goal

Implement Compliance Frameworks for core tooling

## Impact

By establishing a robust compliance framework for core tooling used in projects
like Erlang, Elixir, Gleam, and Hex, this milestone will drive the consistent
adoption of industry-leading security and quality standards across the open
source ecosystem. By integrating OpenSSF Best Practices Badge, Security
Insights, and ScoreCard, developers can more easily identify, measure, and
address critical security gaps, thus ensuring that each project aligns with
recognized best practices. The addition of a statistics tool to track adoption
further amplifies transparency, enabling real-time monitoring of improvements
and facilitating continuous growth in community-wide security awareness.
Ultimately, this milestone fosters a healthier and more resilient open source
environment, elevating trust for developers and end-users alike.
