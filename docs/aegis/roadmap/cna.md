## Goal

Implement CVE Numbering Authority for Erlang, Elixir, Gleam, Hex.pm and
  fallback for all Hex.pm packages.

## Impact

By establishing a dedicated CNA within the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation—covering
Erlang, Elixir, Gleam, Hex.pm, and acting as a fallback for all Hex.pm packages
— this milestone ensures a more streamlined, authoritative, and timely process
for identifying and remediating security vulnerabilities. Formal CNA
registration with MITRE, coupled with a dedicated website and a well-defined
team of points of contact, fosters transparency and prompt disclosure across the
open source community. Adhering to relevant guidelines such as the CNA
Operational Rules and recommendations for open source CNA formations, this
initiative significantly enhances the security posture of the ecosystem,
ultimately building greater trust and resilience for developers and users alike.

## Deliverables

* CNA Registration with MITRE
* CNA Website
* Working Team of Points of Contact
