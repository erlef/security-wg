**Essential Components of a Security Disclosure Process**

A robust security disclosure process is essential for effectively handling
security vulnerabilities in library projects within the BEAM ecosystem. While
this document provides an overview of key components, further details and best
practices can be found in resources such as the OpenSSF guide,
["Guide to implementing a coordinated vulnerability disclosure process for open source projects."](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/maintainer-guide.md)
Below are the most essential parts of a security disclosure process:

1. **Publish your vulnerability management process**:
   - The first step is to create and publish a clear and comprehensive document
     outlining the security disclosure process for the library project. This
     document should detail the steps for reporting vulnerabilities, the
     expected timeline for response and resolution, and the communication
     channels to be used.

1. **Accepting User Reports**:
   - Establish mechanisms for users to report security vulnerabilities securely.
     Provide clear instructions on how users can submit reports, including
     contact information, or dedicated reporting channels such as email addresses
     or bug tracking systems.

2. **Communicating the State of the Disclosure Back to the Reporter**:
   - Upon receiving a vulnerability report, acknowledge the receipt of the
     report and provide an initial assessment of its validity and severity.
     Keep the reporter informed about the progress of the disclosure process,
     including any investigations, mitigations, or fixes implemented.

3. **Implementing & Publishing a Fix**:
   - Once a vulnerability is confirmed, work promptly to develop and implement a
     fix. Ensure that the fix addresses the root cause of the vulnerability and
     does not introduce regressions or new issues. Once the fix is ready,
     publish it along with clear instructions for users to update their
     installations.

4. **Disclosing the Vulnerability (CVE & Hex)**:
   - After the fix has been implemented and distributed to users, disclose the
     vulnerability publicly. Assign a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
     identifier to the vulnerability, if applicable, to facilitate tracking and
     referencing. Additionally, update the retirement status (
     [Elixir](https://hexdocs.pm/hex/Mix.Tasks.Hex.Retire.html) /
     [Erlang](https://rebar3.org/docs/package_management/#retiring-packages))
     of the affected package on Hex, if necessary, to alert users to the presence
     of the vulnerability.

It's important to note that while these are the essential components of a
security disclosure process, each project may have unique considerations and
requirements. Regular review and refinement of the process are recommended to
adapt to evolving security landscape and community feedback. For further
guidance and detailed best practices, refer to the
[OpenSSF guide on coordinated vulnerability disclosure processes for open source projects](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/maintainer-guide.md).
