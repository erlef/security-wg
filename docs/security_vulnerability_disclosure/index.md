In the dynamic and rapidly evolving landscape of software development, ensuring
the security of libraries and frameworks is paramount. The BEAM ecosystem, which
includes Erlang, Elixir, Gleam and LFE among others, is renowned for its
robustness, scalability, and fault-tolerance. However, like any other technology
stack, it is not immune to security vulnerabilities. As library authors play a
crucial role in maintaining the integrity and security of the BEAM ecosystem, it
becomes imperative to establish clear guidelines for disclosing and addressing
security vulnerabilities.

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for library authors within the
BEAM community, outlining the processes and best practices for handling security
vulnerabilities effectively. By following these guidelines, library authors can
contribute to enhancing the overall security posture of the BEAM ecosystem while
fostering transparency and collaboration among developers, security researchers,
and end-users.

The objectives of this document are threefold:

* **Clarifying Responsibilities:** Library authors need to understand their
  responsibilities concerning the discovery, disclosure, and mitigation of
  security vulnerabilities in their codebases. Clear delineation of roles and
  expectations ensures a coordinated and timely response to security incidents.
* **Establishing Reporting Mechanisms:** Effective communication channels are
  vital for reporting security vulnerabilities. This document outlines the
  preferred methods and contacts for reporting security issues, facilitating
  prompt assessment and remediation.
* **Implementing Remediation Procedures:** Upon receiving reports of security
  vulnerabilities, library authors must follow structured procedures for
  triaging, validating, and addressing the reported issues. Timely patches or
  updates should be developed and communicated to users to mitigate potential
  risks.

By adhering to these guidelines, library authors can demonstrate their
commitment to maintaining a secure and resilient BEAM ecosystem, earning the
trust and confidence of their users and stakeholders. Together, we can create a
safer environment for building and deploying applications, safeguarding critical
systems and sensitive data against emerging threats.

The ErlEF Security Working Group ([security@erlef.org](mailto:security@erlef.org))
offers to connect individuals with experts who can assist in coordinating and
disclosing vulnerabilities within the BEAM ecosystem. While the WG does not
handle direct disclosures, it helps to facilitate communication with experienced
professionals in security vulnerability management.
