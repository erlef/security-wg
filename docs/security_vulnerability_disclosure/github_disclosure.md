GitHub provides several features to facilitate the security disclosure process
for open-source projects, ensuring timely and effective resolution of
vulnerabilities. Below are key features of GitHub's security disclosure process:

1. [**Private Reporting**](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability):
   - GitHub offers a secure and private channel for reporting security
     vulnerabilities directly to project maintainers. Users can submit
     vulnerability reports confidentially, allowing maintainers to assess and
     address the issues before they are publicly disclosed.
   - Private reporting helps prevent premature disclosure of vulnerabilities,
     giving maintainers the opportunity to develop and deploy fixes before
     potential attackers exploit the vulnerabilities.

2. [**Publishing the Vulnerability**](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/managing-privately-reported-security-vulnerabilities):
   - Once a vulnerability has been identified, GitHub provides tools for
     publishing detailed descriptions of the vulnerability, including its
     impact, affected versions of the library or package, and relevant Common
     Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers.
   - Maintainers can document the vulnerability on GitHub, providing clear and
     comprehensive information for users and stakeholders. This documentation
     helps users understand the nature and severity of the vulnerability and
     take appropriate action to protect their systems.

3. **CVE Requests**:
   - GitHub supports the request and assignment of Common Vulnerabilities and
     Exposures (CVE) identifiers for reported vulnerabilities. Maintainers can
     request CVE identifiers directly through GitHub's security advisory
     interface.
   - GitHub streamlines the process of requesting CVE identifiers, reducing the
     administrative burden on maintainers and ensuring that vulnerabilities are
     properly cataloged and tracked in the CVE database.
   - By assigning CVE identifiers, maintainers contribute to the standardization
     and visibility of vulnerability information, enabling better coordination
     and collaboration within the security community.

GitHub's security disclosure process features empower maintainers to effectively
manage security vulnerabilities in their projects while maintaining transparency
and accountability. From private reporting channels to streamlined CVE requests,
GitHub provides a comprehensive toolkit for handling security incidents and
safeguarding the integrity of open-source software projects.

You can see an example for this process in a disclosure for one of
[ErlEFs libraries](https://github.com/erlef/oidcc/security/advisories/GHSA-mj35-2rgf-cv8p).
