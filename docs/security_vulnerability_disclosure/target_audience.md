## Who is this document for?


The target audience for this document primarily comprises library authors within
the BEAM ecosystem, encompassing developers who design, maintain, and distribute
libraries and frameworks for use by other developers. Within this broad
audience, several key segments can be identified, including:

* **Open Source Library Maintainers & Contributors:** This group consists of
  individual developers and team members who create, maintain, and contribute to
  open-source libraries and frameworks within the BEAM ecosystem. It includes
  those responsible for the full lifecycle of library development and
  maintenance, from design to support.
* **Commercial Library Providers:** These are organizations and individuals who
  develop and distribute commercial libraries or frameworks for development on
  the BEAM. They must adhere to stringent security practices to ensure customer
  trust and compliance.
* **Security-Conscious Developers:** These developers, although not directly
  involved in library maintenance, rely on third-party libraries and benefit
  from understanding the security vulnerability disclosure processes. This
  knowledge helps them assess and mitigate risks effectively.

For maintainers of popular libraries, in particular, the document addresses
their unique position within the BEAM ecosystem. Given the extensive usage and
potential impact of their libraries, maintainers of popular projects must be
especially diligent in handling security vulnerabilities promptly and
transparently. Their actions can significantly influence the overall security
posture of the BEAM community, making them a key focus of the guidelines
outlined in the document.
